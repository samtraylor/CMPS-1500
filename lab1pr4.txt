	Diversity in users can create a need for change in some of the most commonly used products that exist today. One example is the huge number of sites that use verification software like captcha to make sure users are human. This brings a challenge because the way we normally verify it, by having a user look at a distorted sequence of letters and determine them, doesn't work for some types of people, like the blind. In situations like this, the creators of the software have to come up with alternatives, like how captcha offers to play an audio clip that someone can listen to and write out the words
	Another group that technology has to be adapted for is the elderly. Generally speaking, many older people need a feature on their device that can make letters bigger so that they can read the screen, and now that feature comes standard in most large implementations of tech. It can also read out things that may be hard to see using speech to text.
	Online video games are a type of tech that also has to adapt to different users, specifically users in other countries or regions due to the networking challenges. Instead of just having servers across America that anyone can connect to and play, we now have players from all over the world, and their connection would be terrible if they used an American server. The design fix for this was to make separate regional servers, so that for example, European players can use a Europe server 
	Video games also have to accommodate the different languages spoken across the world. The main way this is done is by having a folder somewhere in the directory with a large number of files called language files. Those files contain the translated text for specific languages, and when someone switches the language, certain aspects of the game (like menus) will display in their native tongue.
