(A)The speaker's main argument is totally valid. Yes, hackers are the 'immune system' of software applications and internet sites, because they're the ones who find the vulnerabilities that companies making technology cannot find. Without hackers, it's up to the teams developing software to take on both the role of making a product, and breaking the product, which obviously isn't 100% effective

(B) The people with the skillset to find vulnerabilities have the choice of using their zero-day exploit (an exploit not known by software developers and therefor not patched) for malicious purposes, or disclosing the vulnerability to the programmers responsible so it can be fixed. Some people choose to disclose a vulnerability's existence by publicly taking advantage of it, like the man Elazari mentioned, who publicly showed the exploit in the ATM system. Unless you are a white-hat hacker, meaning you hack by-the-books and disclose your findings, you can be held responsible, which is kind of fair, but I think that more companies and programs should offer bug-bounty programs as a way for these hackers to do their work legally, benefitting everyone.

(C)There are plenty of negative possibilities when a hacker finds a vulnerability, but there are also positive ones. Depending on the morals and the intent of the hacker, they could steal, modify, erase, or watch data that's used in a system, but they also could just determine the way in, and disclose that as a potential avenue for exploits. There are hackers that work with bug-bounty programs from home and other penetration testers that are contracted by companies, but either way, that kind of professional could save companies and websites millions, sometimes billions of dollars that otherwise would be lost in a cyberattack. Of course, hacking has earned a negative connotation because the early days of hacking didn't have support from corporations (bug bounty programs didn't exist), meaning most of the hacks that got a lot of press were malicious in nature, but not all hacks are bad.
