Gaming technology has been used in tons of unexpected non-entertainment ways. One example I distinctly remember hearing about after getting an Xbox 360 with Kinect was that the Kinect sensor (a  modified version) was being used for cardiovascular surgery. Scientists turned a device for leisurely fun into an apparatus for surgery. The system could allow specialists from any part of the world to perform tasks virtually, which would be translated into instructions for actual surgery carried out by robots receiving the input. Another example video games having benefits outside just entertainment is the cognitive improvement gained by kids and young adults playing certain games. Not all games are mindless, and some, like portal and portal 2, are thought-provoking puzzle games that challenge your application of logic, problem solving, spacial awareness and abstract thinking. Studies have emerged which have found measurable impact on individuals playing games, and they support the idea that the type of problem solving you're made to do can make you cognitively sharper. Another place where virtual events helped to develop real life skill is in the world of military training. Over the years, the military has tested the use of training simulations on soldiers to develop better tactics, team cohesion, and combat skills. The early examples were sometimes structured around commercially available games that were modified, which was done to Half-Life and Doom in the 90's. The ability to learn skills and tactics without moving someplace for a training exercise and without using up real ammunition is valuable to the military. As tech progresses, the military now looks at doing simulations that are more immersive, like virtual reality, so that what you're doing is more tangible and engaging
