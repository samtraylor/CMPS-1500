A. Duolinguo handles the novice skill level of the learners by not relying on single translation from one user, but rather combining many responses into an aggregate passage representing the average input. This could be used in almost any other system that uses feedback from sources that aren't completely reliable. Instead of relying on the possibly faulty answer of one individual, you can determine the average response for a more representative result

B. Another example of web-powered problem solving would be the website stack exchange. It complies answers to technical, often computer science related questions from the programming community, and has millions of users. Another example of a site that thrives off it's users is the apple support page. If it weren't for the vast community of apple users that troubleshoot their own problems and come up with answers, apple would never be able to answer every question with just their staff.

C. There's plenty of noticeable examples of humans being benefitted by computers and networking them. One important example is the concept of websites that serve as databases for health information, like WebMD and Mayoclinic. Those websites help to coordinate an amount of specific human knowledge from all across the globe that would never have been possible before human networking. Another example is wikipedia, which serves as a general database for human knowledge across many different languages. In the past, the information did exist, but It was spread across tons of different dictionaries in countless different languages. A third example would be would be a very obvious one, google, which is the main conduit for coordinating all the internet's contents across the whole world. Without a comprehensive, adaptive search engine like google it would take hours, if not days to scroll through an arbitrarily ordered list of web results trying to get a certain site.
