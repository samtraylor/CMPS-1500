Cybersecurity Video Reflection
	Identity theft is a huge problem because you can control or ruin so many aspects of peoples life if you have access to their identity. It’s such a scary issue because often times, if the person knows one or two things about you, they can use that to pivot and gain access to other areas of your personal data. In cybersecurity there’s a concept called lateral movement, where you use some sort of access or credentials to get into a system and grab more info/control within the same security context (you aren’t escalating privileges on a system), and that’s very prevalent with real life identity theft too. For example, information like your cell phone number and date of birth can be used to access records about a person, leading to even more information in the wrong hands. If someone has access to your email account though, that’s the authentication method for numerous other websites and accounts, so they have access to the place where password change emails go, etc.
	I think I do a pretty good job of being careful and conscious of what I post online and how I post it. Sure, my photos are have gps information embedded in their code but that’s basically totally inconsequential. I make sure to be careful about what emails and websites I open, what networks I connect to and whether I enter credentials over a network. I have a level of care to the way I use technology mainly because I know a lot about cybersecurity, and it keeps me from really becoming a victim online because I know what to avoid. I’m not a security freak in day to day life, because of the convenience/security trade off. I want to enjoy my conveniences because security isn’t that Important when you aren’t that important, aren’t really a target.
